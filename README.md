# Eat Da Taco

* Eat-Da-Taco is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.
 Whenever a user submits a taco's name, your app will display the taco on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
 Each taco in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco will move to the right side of the page.
 Your app will store every taco in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
